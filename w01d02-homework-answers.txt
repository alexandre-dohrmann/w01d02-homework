4.  Why is it important to use -- when changing files back to a previous state?
	Answer: The double dash -- in git means different things to different commands, 	but in general it separates options from parameters. In git specifically, the --	depends on which subcommand you are using. It 	usually separates subcommand 		arguments (like the branch name in git checkout) from revisions or filenames.		Sometimes it is completely optional, and used only to prevent unusual filename 		being interpreted as program options.

5.  Why might you want to reset your files back to a previous commit?
	Answer: You might want to do this if you've made mistakes and/or want to replace 	the history.
